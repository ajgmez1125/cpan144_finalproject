This is the final project for CPAN144 (Adv Front End Development).
Written by Ayden, Alexandr and Nicholas.

The purpose of the project is to create a weather app that fetches data from OpenWeatherAPI
and displays it on our website using the styling and layout we made.

This was made fully in React JS with some wonderful CSS magic by Alex.
